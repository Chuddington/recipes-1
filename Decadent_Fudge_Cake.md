Decadent Fudge Cake

From Southern Living Five-Start Recipe Collection, 1990.

Flo made this dessert for Haidee on her 34th birthday.  It is an awesome chocolate bundt cake, that goes well with whipped cream.  I found it a bit dry.  Flo says she would skip the white chocolate frosting next time.

Ingredients:

- 1 C butter, softened
- 1.5 C sugar
- 4 eggs
- 1/2 t baking soda
- 1 C buttermilk
- 2.5 C all-purpose flour
- 1.5 C semisweet chocolate mini-morsels, divided
- 2 (4-ounce) bars sweet baking chocolate, melted and cooled
- 1/3 C chocolate syrup
- 2 t vanilla extract
- 4 oz white chocolate, chopped
- 2 T + 2 t shortening, divided
- Chocolate and white chocolate leaves (optional)

Directions:

Cream butter in a large mixing bowl;  gradually add sugar, beating well at medium speed of an electric mixer.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition.

Dissolve soda in buttermilk, stirring well.  Add to creamed mixture alternately with flour, beginning and ending with flour.  Add 1 cup mini-morsels, melted chocolate, chocolate syrup, and vanilla, stirring just until blended.  (Do not overbeat.)

Spoon batter into a heavily greased and floured 10-inch Bundt pan.  Bake at 300 degrees for 1 hour and 25-35 minutes or until cake springs back when touched.  Invert cake immediately onto a serving plate, and let cool completely.

Combine 4 ounces chopped white chocolate and 2 tablespoons shortening in top of a double boiler; bring water to a boil.  Reduce heat to low; cook until mixture is melted and smooth.  Remove from heat.  Drizzle melted white chocolate mixture over cooled cake.  Melt remaining 1/2 cup mini-morsels and 2 teaspoons shortening in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring until smooth.  Remove from heat, and let cool; drizzle over white chocolate.  If desired, garnish with chocolate and white chocolate leaves.  

Yield: one 10-inch cake.
