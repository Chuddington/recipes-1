Sauerkraut

Ingredients:

- Cabbage, finely shredded
- Salt, non-iodized

How much salt to use?
Pickl-it recommends a 2% brine solution for pickling cabbage.  They say this can be achieved with 22g salt for every 5 lbs of cabbage, which works out to about 1 g salt / 100 g cabbage.
Mark Frauenfelder recommends a tablespoon per head of cabbage.
