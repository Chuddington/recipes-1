Sauerkraut

Ahh, the trendiness of lacto-fermented sauerkraut, circa 2013.  One of my favorite commercial Sauerkrauts is Bubbie's (http://www.bubbies.com/prod_sauerkraut.shtml).  It has a very thin chop (1-2 mm) and a smooth, mellow flavor.  The ingredients?  Cabbage and salt.

Ingredients:

- 3 medium heads of cabbage, finely shredded
- Salt, non-iodized, about 1-2 g for every 100 g of cabbage.  This should make a 2-4% brine.

Directions:

Three heads should make about a gallon / 4 liters of sauerkraut.

- Quarter the cabbages and remove the stem and outer leaves.
- Finely shred the cabbage.  Using a mandolin is a great way to get a very fine (1 mm thick) and consistent shred.
- Massage the cabbage and salt together in a large bowl
- Pack a large crock or other pickling vessel, perhaps stamping down the cabbage as you fill it.
- Wait a few minutes to a few hours for the salt to draw out enough juice to submerge the cabbage completely under water.
- Optionally seal the cabbage with some saran wrap, especially if you are using an open crock.  This will help reduce the amount of white mold that grows and spoils the flavor.  If you are using a fermenting crock with an airlock, you can skip this step.
- Weight the cabbage down with some stones, a plate, or a ziploc bag filled with brine (water and salt) to keep the cabbage submerged.
- Wait a week or two, tasting as much as you like.  After the flavor develops, pack the sauerkraut in ball jars and refrigerate or store in a cool, dark place.

This recipe should yield about a gallon (4 liters) of sauerkraut.

How much salt to use?  Pickl-it recommends a 2% brine solution for pickling cabbage.  They say this can be achieved with 22g salt for every 5 lbs of cabbage, which works out to about 1 g salt / 100 g cabbage.  Mark Frauenfelder recommends a tablespoon per head of cabbage.  A teaspoon (of table salt) is 18g.  A typical cabbage head is ~3 lbs, so there you go.  Experiment and keep notes.
