## Grains


### Long-grain Brown Rice

This recipe is still a work in progress.  I tried 184g rice (1 cup) and 515g water, but it needed more water.

100g (~0.55 cups)
300g water

Bring ingredients to a boil.  Simmer for ~35 minutes.  Let the rice cool for 5 minutes.  Then fluff it with a fork.

### Quinoa

100g (~1/2 cup) quinoa
250g (~1 cup) water or stock

Rinse quinoa well.  Bring ingredients to a boil.  Simmer 15 minutes.  Let cool for 5 minutes.  Fluff with fork.
