# Green Beans Almondine

Source: http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/02/green-beans-almondine-recipe.html

Ingredients:

- 1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1/3 cup slivered almonds
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- Salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:

1.  Cook green beans in a small amount of salted water until tender but still firm. Drain and rinse with cool water if you're not ready to begin next step immediately.
2.  Heat a large skillet over a medium flame and add the almonds, stirring constantly for about 30 seconds, so they become very lightly toasted.
3.  Add the butter and the lemon juice to the pan and mix with almonds. Add the beans and saut√© for one to two minutes, or until all of the beans are coated.
4.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve in a festive dish at the table.

Variants:

1 Tbsp lime juice instead of 1 tsp lemon juice.  Powerfully citrusy.  Overpowers to some degree the almonds and butter.  Almonds end up intensely citrusy and at times intensely delicous.  Coating of beans with sauce might suffer.
