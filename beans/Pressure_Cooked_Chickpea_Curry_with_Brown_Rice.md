# Recipe: Pressure Cooked Chickpea Curry with Brown Rice (One Pot)

http://www.hippressurecooking.com/2013/01/pressure-cooked-chickpea-curry-with.html

Brown rice can be pressure cooked to fluffy perfection by steaming it in a
heat-proof dish.  This leaves the base of the cooker free to cook a second
dish, like a spicy chickpea curry!

Though the cooking time of rice pressure cooked bain marie is unchanged, the
water to grain ratio is reduced (so pay careful attention to the measurements
in this recipe). The vapor from the food cooking (or water boiling) below
assist in cooking the rice.

Chana masala is a spice mix used to cook chickpeas (chana).  You can pick-up a
package at your local India import store.  If you don't have one nearby, you
can make your own for this recipe by adding 1/4 teaspoon of as many of these
spices as you have on hand: coriander, mango powder,  Pomegranate seeds, hot
pepper powder, cumin, musk melon, black pepper, fenugreek leaves, cloves, mint,
nutmeg, cinnamon, cardamom, caraway, mace and a bay leaf.

This spice mix is both spicy and tangy - with quite a bit of heat.  Though our
recipe calls for two tablespoons of this mix, the box recommends almost four
for the same amount of chickpeas. So this is SPICY!  Increase the quantity at
your own risk!

Pressure Cooker: 6L or larger
Cook Time: 18-20 minutes
Accessories: Steamer basket, Bain marie vessel like a 4-cup pot
Pressure Level: High
Opening Method: Natural (take off heat and let cool)

## Ingredients

For Bain Marie Brown Rice:

- 1 1/2 cups brown rice
- 2 1/4 cups water

For Chickpea Curry:

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 red onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons chana masala (or see description, above)
- 1 tablespoon garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
- 2 cups water
- 1 cup chickpeas, soaked overnight or quick-soaked
- 2 tablespoons tomato concentrate (or large handful of whole cherry tomatoes)
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Directions

In a 4-cup capacity heat proof container add the rice, and water.  If the
container does not have a handle, construct an aluminum foil sling to lower and
raise it out of the pressure cooker. Set aside. 

In the pre-heated pressure cooker, on medium heat without the lid, add the oil
and onion and saute' until it is just starting to caramelize (about 7
minutes).  Next add the chana masala powder garlic and ginger and saute'
for about 30 more seconds until the garlic begins to cook.

Next, pour in the water, chickpeas and tomato concentrate.

Lower the steamer basket (or trivet) into the pressure cooker into the chickpea
curry.  Now, lower the uncovered heat-proof container into the pressure
cooker onto the steamer basket.

Close and lock the lid of the pressure cooker.  Turn the heat up to high
and when the cooker reaches pressure, lower to the heat to the minimum required
by the cooker to maintain pressure. Cook for 18-20 minutes at high pressure.

When time is up,  open the pressure cooker with the Natural release method
- move the cooker  off the burner and wait for the pressure to come down
on its own (about 10 minutes). For electric pressure cookers, disengage the
"keep warm" mode  or unplug the cooker and begin counting 10 minutes of natural
open time. Then, release the rest of the pressure using the valve.

Carefully lift out the heat-proof container and fluff the rice and serve on
individual dishes.  Mix-in the salt with the curry in the base of the
cooker, and spoon it out and serve with an optional dollop of low-fat yogurt.
