# Stewed Chickpeas and Cauliflower

This is what happens when you just throw some food in a pot and cook it a long
time.  By varying the ingredients and spices and when you add ingredients, many
flavor variants could be created.  This was a fun experiment that was received
well by my wife.  Even my 5-year old tried it.

Ingredients:

- 2 T olive oil
- 1 diced onion
- 4 diced celery stalks
- 2 minced garlic cloves
- 1 15oz can diced tomatoes
- 1/2 6oz can tomato paste
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black peppercorns
- 1/2 tsp dried rosemary
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 C soaked chickpeas (about 1 C dried?)
- 2 C broth (e.g. chicken broth)
- 1 small head of cauliflower, diced

Directions:

- Heat olive oil in large pan or pot that has a cover
- Add onions and saut√© on medium heat until clear
- Add celery, garlic, tomatoes, tomato paste, chickpeas, and spices.
- Simmer everything on low heat for an hour
- Add cauliflower and simmer for another hour, until chickpeas are soft and
  everything else is mushy.
