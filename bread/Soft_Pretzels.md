# Soft Pretzels

Source: http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2012/12/25/30-minute-whole-wheat-pretzels/

Time: 35 minutes


Ingredients:

- 1.5 cups (360ml) warm water (lukewarm, no need to take temperature)
- 1 packet active dry or instant yeast (2 and 1/4 teaspoons)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3.75 - 4.25 cups (480-530g) all-purpose flour + more for work surface (or mix of whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour)
- 1 large egg, beaten
- coarse sea salt for sprinkling

Directions:

- Preheat oven to 425째F (218째C). Line baking sheet with parchment paper or
  silicone baking mat. Set aside.
- Dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir with a spoon until fairly mixed, about 1
  minute. Some clusters of yeast will remain. Add salt.  Stir until
  fairly combined. Slowly add 3 cups of flour, 1 cup at a time. Mix with a
  wooden spoon until dough is thick. Add 3/4 cup more flour until the dough is
  no longer sticky. If it is still sticky, add up to 1/2 cup more. Poke the
  dough with your finger - if it bounces back, it is ready to knead.
- Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead the dough for about 3
  minutes and shape into a ball. With a sharp knife, cut ball of dough into 1/3
  cup sections. This measurement does not have to be exact - use as much or
  little dough for each pretzel as you wish - the size of the pretzel is
  completely up to you.
- Roll the dough into a rope with an even diameter, about twenty inches
  long. This measurement will depend how large you want the pretzels. Once you
  have your long rope, take the ends and draw them together so the dough forms
  a circle. Twist the ends, then bring them towards yourself and press them
  down into a pretzel shape. See above for link to visual instructions.
- In a small bowl, beat the egg and pour into a shallow bowl or pie dish. Dunk
  the shaped pretzel into the egg wash (both sides). Place on baking sheet and
  sprinkle with salt.
- Bake for 10 minutes at 425F degrees. Turn the oven to broil and bake for 5
  more minutes to brown the tops. Watch closely to avoid burning. I do the 5
  minute broil no matter if I do step 5 or not.
- Allow to cool and enjoy. Serve warm or at room temperature. Pretzels may be
  stored in an airtight container or zipped top bag for up to 3 days (will lose
  softness).
- Make ahead tip: Pretzels freeze well, up to 2 months. To reheat, bake frozen
  pretzels at 350째F (177째C) for 20 minutes or until warmed through. The
  prepared pretzel dough can be refrigerated for up to one day or frozen in an
  airtight container for 2-3 months. Thaw frozen dough in the refrigerator
  overnight. Refrigerated dough can be shaped into pretzels while still cold,
  but allow some extra time for the pretzels to puff up before the baking soda
  bath and baking.
