Ingredients:

- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 1/3 cup (42g) all-purpose flour (original recipe uses 1/2)
- 1/2 cup (120g) whole milk
- Pinch of ground nutmeg
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
- Juice of half a lemon

Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. In a mixing bowl, lightly beat the eggs.
   Add the flour, milk and nutmeg and lightly beat until blended but still
   slightly lumpy.  Don’t overmix the batter, or the pancake will be tough—a
   few lumps are fine.  
2. Melt the butter in a 12-inch skillet with a heatproof handle over
   medium-high heat. When very hot but not brown, pour in the batter. Bake in
   the oven until the pancake is billowing on the edges and golden brown, about
   15-20 minutes.
3. Working quickly, remove the pan from the oven and, using a fine-meshed
   sieve, sprinkle with the sugar. Return to the oven for 1 to 2 minutes more.
   Sprinkle with lemon juice and serve with jam, pear butter or marmalade.
   Serves 2 to 4.

Variation from Roland Krause:

> Sometimes I sauté thin apple slices sprinkled with a bit of sugar before
> pouring the batter in the pan for a variation on the original recipe.
