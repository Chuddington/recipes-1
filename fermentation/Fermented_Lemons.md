Fermented Lemons and Ginger

There seem to be roughly 2 types of lemon recipes:

- traditional salty ones
- salt and starter varieties

The Art of Fermentation (by Sandor Katz) says:

> Typically sugary fruit and fruit juice will spontaneously ferment into primarily alcohol (and then acetic acid if exposed to air) rather than lactic acid.  ... Yeast activity can be inhibited by heavy salting, or overpowered by the addition of lactic acid starter cultures such as whey.

The salty recipes seem to call for anywhere from 16g of salt per 100g of lemons to 2g of salt per 100g of lemon.  Most recipes I read called for mixing the salt and lemons and adding lemon juice as necessary to submerge the lemons in brine.

This recipe calls for about 4g salt for every 100g of lemon and a starter culture from whey or lacto-fermened brine.

## Ingredients

- 750g lemons, thinly sliced.  About 7 medium lemons.
- 5-10 very thin slices of ginger
- 500g water (about 2 C)
- 25g salt, 2g for every 100g of water and 2g for every 100g of lemons.
- 50g lacto-fermented brine or whey (about 2 Tbsp), as a starter.

## Directions

Combine the water and salt to make a brine.  Thinly slice (about 3mm) the lemons, perhaps using a mandolin.  Put the lemons, ginger, and brine in a quart or 1/2 gallon jar.  Weight the lemons so they stay below the brine.  Close the jar and let it ferment for about 2 weeks.

## Yield

About a quart.

## Usage

No clue.  Check out the Chicken with Lemon and Olives linked to below.  Fish?  Stew?

- [Italian Lacto-Fermented Lemons](http://www.pickl-it.com/blog/364/italian-moroccan-spiced-lacto-fermented-lemon/) are salt-cured, using around 200g of salt (2 Tbsp per lemon).
- [Fermented Lemons](http://theelliotthomestead.com/2012/10/preserved-lemons/) uses relatively little salt and some starter, like whey or brine from a fermentation.
- [Fermented Lemons with Honey](http://theessentialherbal.blogspot.com/2012/11/it-started-with-stroll-through-farmers.html) uses the traditional salty recipe, adds honey after 2 months.  At 2 months they were too salty and at 6 months they were balanced and delicious.
- [Preserved Lemons](http://www.npr.org/2013/04/08/176577903/preserved-lemons-older-wiser-and-full-of-flavor) uses the "salty" method and includes a recipe for Chicken With Preserved Lemon And Green Olives.  Ohh that sounds good.
