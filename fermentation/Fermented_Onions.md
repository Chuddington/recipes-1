Lacto-Fermented Onions

This is my first time fermenting onions.  I read a couple of recipes and then had a go at it.  Below is roughly the recipe I used.

Ingredients:

- 700g onions, about 2 large ones
- salt, about 2g per 100g of onions
- (optional) brine from a previous vegetable ferment, as a starter.
- water, purified, for making additional brine.

Directions:

Slice the onions very thinly.  I use a mandolin (like the Super Benriner) to achieve a thin, consistent slice.  In a bowl, mix the onions, salt and optional starter brine.
Pack the onions into a ball jar or other fermentation vessel.  Add weights and/or brine as necessary to submerge the onions in liquid.  I find a ziploc bag filled with water and salt acts as a good weight, seal, and spacer.

Cover and culture the onions at room temperature for 3 to 7 days.  Then move the onions to cold storage.

If more liquid is needed in the jar, create a brine mixture from 3g salt to 100g water (3% salinity).

Yields:

About a quart.

Usage:

Garnish salads, burgers, hot dogs.  Eat raw to introduce microbes to your gut.  Add to soup, stir-fry, or other cooked dishes.
