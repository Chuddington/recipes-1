Fermented Pineapple

Is this a good idea?  Probably not.  Maybe I should try it without the skin next time.

Ingredients:

- 1300g overripe pineapple, chopped.
- About a quarter of the pineapple skin.
- Water

Directions:

Layer pieces of the skin and pineapple into a jar.  Mush the pineapple down.  Add some water to cover the fruit and a weight to hold it down.  Close the jar with an airlock lid.
