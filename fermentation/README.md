# Fermentation

Here is information I have collected while learning how to ferment vegetables.

## Airlock Ball Jar Lid

Some people think that fermenting in the anaerobic environment achieved by using an airlock makes fermenting easier, more consistent and more delicious.  Some examples:

- [Fermentation Equipment, Part 1: Airlocks][3].
- [Mark Frauenfelder's Go-To Sauerkraut][4].

Here is how to make a lid for a ball jar with an airlock inside it.  Ingredients:

- A lid that can seal.  The [Tattler Reusable Wide Mouth Canning Lid][10] seals well and is thicker than a plastic ball jar lid.  Its thick and brittle plastic makes it difficult to drill a clean hole.  I recommend drilling slowly using a split point drill bit (not a pilot point) and moderate pressure.  The [Ball Plastic Storage Cap][9] is softer and easier to drill.  It does not seal well, so you should also use a [Tattler Reusable Wide Canning Rubber Seal. Ring](http://www.amazon.com/Tattler-Reusable-Canning-Rubber-Dishwasher/dp/B004PKGU28/)
- A drill bit.  I've found that a 7/16" produces a slightly too small hole for my airlocks.  A 1/2" drill bit makes a hole that is too large to create a good seal.  Definitely not what you want.
- A [3 Piece Plastic Airlock][11].
- A [Rubber Grommet][15], to seal the airlock to the lid.

All of the ingredients can be bought on Amazon.  Most or all of them can also be picked up at a local store.  My local Walmart sell Ball jar lids.  [Vermont Homebrew Supply][12] sells airlocks and grommets for less than I would pay online.  All together, the ingredients cost less than $3, circa 2014.

Directions:

Clamp the lid down.  Drill a hole in it.  Insert the grommet into the hole.  Insert the airlock into the grommet.

Usage:

Place a seal on the jar.  Screw the cap onto the seal.

## Brine

Here are [brine recommendations](http://www.pickl-it.com/blog/636/brine-recommendations/) from the Pickl-it blog.  I have read that you should only use non-iodized salt.

For sauerkraut, based on the Pickl-it recommendation, I use 1g salt for every 100g cabbage.  This should produce about a 2% brine, which I found to be very mild.  Use more salt (or less) as desired.

For a 2% brine, add 2g salt to every 100g of water.  For a 5% brine, add 5g instead.  For non-metric recipes:

- 1 tablespoon of Morton's table salt is 18g
- 1 cup of water is 237g.

With a starting ratio, I can explore more precisely the effects that different salinities have on the ferment.

## Fermentation Vessels

### Open Vessels

Fermentation can happen in any crock or jar.  These crocks let in airborne yeasts and bacteria.  The aerobic (oxygen-rich) environment at the top of the jar is a fertile place for molds and yeasts to grow.  One must keep the fermenting food carefully submerged in brine to avoid mold growing on it.  The mold (and moldy food) should be removed frequently, to avoid bad flavors and textures.  Consider sealing the food with cling wrap or a ziplock bag filled with brine (which also weighs the food down).

Examples:

- [Ohio Stoneware 1-Gallon Crock](http://www.amazon.com/Ohio-Stoneware-1GC-Crock-7-34/dp/B002P4PS3S/)

### Sealed Vessels

A ball jar is an example of a sealed vessel.  I've never used one before.  During fermentation, they need to be "burped", opened, occassionally to avoid having the vessel explode from buildup of carbon dioxide pressure.  I imagine these vessels also have some mold build up, since they are periodically opened, allowing oxygen-rich air inside.

Examples:

- [Ball Wide-Mouth Mason Jars with Lids and Bands](http://www.amazon.com/Ball-Wide-Mouth-Quart-Bands/dp/B005T6FBOK/)


### Airlocked Vessels

Vessels with an airlock produce an anaerobic environment within, as the carbon dioxide produced by fermentation dilutes and expels any air.  This inhibits the growth of molds and yeasts, potentially leading to crisper fermented vegetables, better flavor, and more consistent results.  Importantly, it also reduces or eliminates the need to clean mold from the top of the ferment.

Examples:

- [Kraut Kap](http://www.amazon.com/Primal-Kitchen-Kraut-Kap-Platinum/dp/B009RT4W9U/)
- [Pickl-It](http://www.pickl-it.com/)
- [Nik Schmitt Fermenting Crock](http://www.amazon.com/Schmitt-Gairtopf-German-Fermenting-Crock/dp/B00BMHZL5Y/)


## Packing the Fermentation Vessel

When fermenting vegetables, they should be packed into a vessel, pushed down beneath their brine.  If there is not enough brine to submerge the vegetables, then add a brine mixture (of the appropriate strength) to cover the vegetables.  A weight -- a plate with a water bottle on top, stoneware semicircular weights, or a ziploc bag filled with brine -- can and probably should be used to hold the vegetables under the brine, especially if fermenting in an open-air container.  I am still experimenting with airlocked containers.

## Cold Storage

A typical vegetable fermentation cultures at room temperature for a few days to a few weeks before being moved to cold storage for the long term.  Cold storage could be a refrigerator, basement, root cellar, wine cellar, etc.  The fermentation process will be slowed by the cold, preserving the food for longer.



## Further Reading

[The Art of Fermentation](http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Fermentation-Exploration-Essential/dp/160358286X/) by Sandor Ellix Katz.  From the Foreword by Michael Pollan:

> The Art of Fermentation is much more than a cookbook...Sure, it tells you how to do it, but much more important, it tells you what it means, and why an act as quotidian and practical as making your own sauerkraut represents nothing less than a way of engaging with the world. Or rather, with several different worlds, each nested inside the other: the invisible world of fungi and bacteria; the community in which you live; and the industrial food system that is undermining the health of our bodies and the land. This might seem like a large claim for a crock of sauerkraut, but Sandor Katz's signal achievement in this book is to convince you of its truth. To ferment your own food is to lodge an eloquent protest-of the senses-against the homogenization of flavors and food experiences now rolling like a great, undifferentiated lawn across the globe. It is also a declaration of independence from an economy that would much prefer we were all passive consumers of its commodities, rather than creators of unique products expressive of ourselves and the places where we live.
