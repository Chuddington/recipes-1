# Recipe: Haidee's Black-eyed Peas

Haidee made this for New Year's Day 2014.  The secret is sauteing the onions for a long time.

Ingredients:

- dried black-eyed peas
- 1 chopped onion
- 1 bay leaf
- salt

Directions:

Soak the peas overnight.  Then saute the onion on low heat for 1 hour.  Add
the peas, barely cover with water.  Boil for 10 minutes.  Turn down to a
simmer.  Add bay leaf.  Add salt to taste now or later.  Simmer until done.


# Recipe: Thai Coconut Corn And Mushroom Soup

http://bevcooks.com/2013/08/thai-coconut-corn-and-mushroom-soup/

Ingredients:

- 2 Tbs. Thai red curry paste
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 (14 oz) can coconut milk
- 1 1/2 cups chicken stock
- 4 ears sweet corn, kernels removed
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced into small strips
- 8 oz baby bella mushrooms, lightly rinsed and sliced
- 4 cups baby spinach
- juice of 1-2 limes (to taste)
- 1/2 tsp fish sauce (don’t be scared)
- coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1/2 cup cilantro leaves, plus more for garnish
- 2 Thai bird chiles, thinly sliced (optional, for garnish)

Directions:

Place a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the curry paste and press it into
the pot, releasing the oils. Do this for about a minute. Add the garlic and 1/3
cup coconut milk and stir to combine and bloom and become fragrant. Oh yes.

Then add the rest of the coconut milk and chicken stock. As it gets warmer,
taste it. Add as much salt and pepper as you need to bring out the good
flavors. A few little pinches.

Then add the corn, red bell pepper and mushrooms. Let simmer about 5 minutes,
until everything is heated through. Add the spinach to wilt. Taste it. Almost
there.

Take it off the heat and squeeze in a good Tbs. or two of lime juice, along
with the fish sauce. Stir and taste. Like it? Oh yeah. Add the cilantro and
maybe one last pinch of salt if needed.

Serve garnished with cilantro and sliced Thai bird chiles. And more lime
wedges! I’m obsessed with lime.



# Recipe: Molten Chocolate Cakes

By Jean-Georges Vongerichten

Active: 20 Min
Total Time: 35 Min
Servings: Makes Four 6-Ounce Cakes

It seems as though every restaurant in America offers a version of this amazing
cake created by master chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. But his supremely rich
and chocolaty original is in a class by itself.

Ingredients:

- 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter
- 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, preferably Valrhona
- 2 eggs
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/4 cup sugar
- Pinch of salt
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1. Preheat the oven to 450°. Butter and lightly flour four 6-ounce ramekins.
   Tap out the excess flour. Set the ramekins on a baking sheet.
2. In a double boiler, over simmering water, melt the butter with the
   chocolate. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with the egg yolks, sugar and
   salt at high speed until thickened and pale.
3. Whisk the chocolate until smooth. Quickly fold it into the egg mixture along
   with the flour. Spoon the batter into the prepared ramekins and bake for 12
   minutes, or until the sides of the cakes are firm but the centers are soft.
   Let the cakes cool in the ramekins for 1 minute, then cover each with an
   inverted dessert plate. Carefully turn each one over, let stand for 10
   seconds and then unmold. Serve immediately.

Make Ahead: The batter can be refrigerated for several hours; bring to room
temperature before baking.
Suggested Pairing: Chocolate is too intense and bitter for many sweet wines,
but not port. Try this dessert with a Ruby Porto.

Alternative recipe from NYTimes with Mark Bitman and Jean-Georges:

Ingredients:

- 1 stick (4 oz) butter
- 4 oz chocolate
- 2 eggs
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/4 cup sugar

Follow recipe above, but only bake for 6-8 minutes, checking at 6 minutes.

# Recipe: Bean and Green Herb Stew

By Martha Rose Shulman
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/health/beans-and-greens-a-power-couple-recipes-for-health.html

This is inspired by a famous Persian stew that is traditionally made with
chicken and kidney beans. I came across a vegetarian rendition of the stew in
Louisa Shafia’s wonderful new book, “The New Persian Kitchen.” Louisa uses tofu
in her stew; I’m just focusing on the beans, herbs and spinach.

It’s crucial to cook red kidney beans thoroughly, because they contain a
naturally occurring toxin called phytohemagglutinin that causes extreme
intestinal distress but is reduced to harmless levels when the beans are boiled
for a sufficient amount of time (10 minutes is sufficient, according to the
Food and Drug Administration, but of course beans require a lot more cooking
than that to soften). You should not cook them in a crockpot because the
temperature may not be high enough to destroy the toxin, and you should discard
the soaking water.

Ingredients:

- 1 cup red kidney beans (either the small or the larger, more elongated variety), soaked for 4 hours or longer in 1 quart water
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 large onions, 1 cut in half, the other thinly sliced
- Salt to taste
- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or grapeseed oil, plus additional olive oil for drizzling
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 generous bunch spinach (about 3/4 pound), stemmed, washed thoroughly and coarsely chopped, or 2 6-ounce bags baby spinach
- 1 cup tightly packed, coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley
- 1 cup tightly packed, coarsely chopped cilantro
- 1 cup thinly sliced scallions (2 bunches)
- 2 dried limes (available in Persian markets), soaked in hot water to cover for 15 minutes (optional) (place a small plate over the limes to keep them submerged)
- Freshly ground pepper
- Fresh lemon juice for serving

1. Drain the kidney beans and rinse. Place in a large saucepan and add 1 quart
   fresh water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and skim off any foam.
   Add the bay leaf, halved onion, 1 of the garlic cloves, and salt to taste.
   Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer 1 hour. Remove the bay leaf and
   halved onion and discard.
2. Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium heat in a heavy soup pot or
   Dutch oven and add the sliced onion. Cook, stirring often, until it begins
   to color. Turn the heat to low, add a generous pinch of salt and continue to
   cook, stirring often, until the onion is dark brown and has melted down to
   about half its original volume, about 20 minutes. Stir in the remaining
   garlic and cook, stirring, until it is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the
   beans with their broth and bring to a simmer. Simmer, partly covered, for 30
   to 60 minutes, until the beans are tender. Taste and adjust salt.
3. Add the spinach by the handful, stirring until wilted before adding the next
   handful, until all of the spinach has been added. Stir in the herbs and
   scallions. Using a needle, pierce the limes in a few places and add them
   along with 1/2 cup of their soaking water (if you aren’t using the limes,
   just add an additional 1/2 cup water). Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until
   the greens and herbs are tender but still bright. Taste and adjust salt. Add
   pepper. Remove the dried limes before serving.
4. Serve with lemon wedges and squeeze fresh lemon juice into each bowl.

Note: You can also add lemon juice directly to the stew, but the acid will dull the color of the greens in a short time.

Yield: 4 servings

Advance preparation: Make this through Step 2 up to 3 days ahead and keep in the refrigerator, or freeze for up to a month. For the most vibrant flavor, it’s best to serve shortly after adding the spinach and herbs.

# Recipe: Pressure Cooked Chickpea Curry with Brown Rice (One Pot)

http://www.hippressurecooking.com/2013/01/pressure-cooked-chickpea-curry-with.html

Brown rice can be pressure cooked to fluffy perfection by steaming it in a
heat-proof dish.  This leaves the base of the cooker free to cook a second
dish, like a spicy chickpea curry!

Though the cooking time of rice pressure cooked bain marie is unchanged, the
water to grain ratio is reduced (so pay careful attention to the measurements
in this recipe). The vapor from the food cooking (or water boiling) below
assist in cooking the rice.

Chana masala is a spice mix used to cook chickpeas (chana).  You can pick-up a
package at your local India import store.  If you don't have one nearby, you
can make your own for this recipe by adding 1/4 teaspoon of as many of these
spices as you have on hand: coriander, mango powder,  Pomegranate seeds, hot
pepper powder, cumin, musk melon, black pepper, fenugreek leaves, cloves, mint,
nutmeg, cinnamon, cardamom, caraway, mace and a bay leaf.

This spice mix is both spicy and tangy - with quite a bit of heat.  Though our
recipe calls for two tablespoons of this mix, the box recommends almost four
for the same amount of chickpeas. So this is SPICY!  Increase the quantity at
your own risk!

Pressure Cooker: 6L or larger
Cook Time: 18-20 minutes
Accessories: Steamer basket, Bain marie vessel like a 4-cup pot
Pressure Level: High
Opening Method: Natural (take off heat and let cool)

## Ingredients

For Bain Marie Brown Rice:

- 1 1/2 cups brown rice
- 2 1/4 cups water

For Chickpea Curry:

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 red onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons chana masala (or see description, above)
- 1 tablespoon garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
- 2 cups water
- 1 cup chickpeas, soaked overnight or quick-soaked
- 2 tablespoons tomato concentrate (or large handful of whole cherry tomatoes)
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Directions

In a 4-cup capacity heat proof container add the rice, and water.  If the
container does not have a handle, construct an aluminum foil sling to lower and
raise it out of the pressure cooker. Set aside. 

In the pre-heated pressure cooker, on medium heat without the lid, add the oil
and onion and saute' until it is just starting to caramelize (about 7
minutes).  Next add the chana masala powder garlic and ginger and saute'
for about 30 more seconds until the garlic begins to cook.

Next, pour in the water, chickpeas and tomato concentrate.

Lower the steamer basket (or trivet) into the pressure cooker into the chickpea
curry.  Now, lower the uncovered heat-proof container into the pressure
cooker onto the steamer basket.

Close and lock the lid of the pressure cooker.  Turn the heat up to high
and when the cooker reaches pressure, lower to the heat to the minimum required
by the cooker to maintain pressure. Cook for 18-20 minutes at high pressure.

When time is up,  open the pressure cooker with the Natural release method
- move the cooker  off the burner and wait for the pressure to come down
on its own (about 10 minutes). For electric pressure cookers, disengage the
"keep warm" mode  or unplug the cooker and begin counting 10 minutes of natural
open time. Then, release the rest of the pressure using the valve.

Carefully lift out the heat-proof container and fluff the rice and serve on
individual dishes.  Mix-in the salt with the curry in the base of the
cooker, and spoon it out and serve with an optional dollop of low-fat yogurt.

Serves 4 to 6

# Recipe: Todd's Beef Bacon Lentil Stew

Comments: Made it with 2.5 Quarts chicken stock, which is too much.  To avoid overcooking them, ideally the
lentils would be added after the meat had cooked awhile.  It could use more
spicing.  It is tasty but plain.

Ingredients:

1-2 lbs cubed stew meat.
2 large vidalia (sweet) onions, chopped.
2 cloves garlic, chopped.
1 Tbsp butter
8 carrots, chopped.
4 potatoes or sweet potatoes, chopped.
3 slices bacon
2 cups lentils
2 quarts homemade chicken stock.
12 oz. stout beer
1 tsp (or less) kosher sea salt ;-)
1 tbsp worchestershire sauce
2 bay leaves

Pressure Cooker Preparation:

Brown the beef cubes in a beautiful cast-iron pan.  Put them into the 8-quart
pressure cooker pot.  Saute the onions and garlic in the butter and add it to
the pot.  Fry the bacon until crispy and add it to the pot.  Sizzle the lentils
in the bacon grease and add them to the pot.  Add the remaining ingredients to
the pot, close it up, bring the pot up to pressure, and cook for 12 minutes.
Then turn off the heat and let the pot depressurize on its own.

# Recipe: White Bean Dip

http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2012/09/white-bean-dip-recipe/

Six to eight appetizer-sized servings

Soaking the beans the night before drastically reduces the cooking time. And
I’ll often cook extra beans, to maximize my energy-efficiency, and use them for
soup. If using canned white beans, or making a big pot, you’ll need 2 cups
(380g) of beans, drained for the dip.

Reserve some of the liquid, as indicated in the recipe for making the dip. You
can use whatever herbs you like. Fresh basil works quite well, as does sage,
and tarragon would add a nice sharpness.

Serve the dip with toasted slices of bread, or whole-grain crackers.

Ingredients:

- 3/4 cup (6 ounces, 225g) dried white beans
- One bay leaf
- 1/4 cup (60ml) bean cooking liquid
- 2 medium cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon salt
- generous pinch of red pepper powder
- Additional olive oil and fresh herbs, for garnish

Directions:

1. Rinse the dried beans and sort them, checking for stones or debris. Soak the
   beans overnight in cold water.
2. The next day, bring the beans to a gentle boil with a bay leaf, making sure
   there is plenty of water covering them. Cook until completely tender, 1 to 2
   hours, depending on the beans.  (If you live in an area with hard water, a
   pinch of baking soda can be added to the water to help the beans cook and
   soften.)
3. Drain the beans, reserving some of the liquid. Puck out the bay leaf and let
   the beans cool until tepid.
4. Put the beans along with 1/4 cup (60ml) of their cooking liquid in a blender
   or food processor, and blend with the garlic, dill, mint, parsley, olive
   oil, lemon juice, salt, and red pepper powder. You’ll need to stop the
   machine a few times and scrape down the sides, but do puree it long enough
   for it to be completely smooth, which will take several minutes.
5. Taste, and adjust for seasoning, adding more salt or olive oil if desired.
   If it’s too thick, add a tablespoon or so of the reserved bean liquid or
   olive oil. Garnish with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a scattering of
   fresh chopped herbs.
