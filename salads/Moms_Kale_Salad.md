# Recipe: Mom's Kale Salad

Here's my kale salad recipe:

Kale: black, purple, locinato, and/or green in any mix desired (or available at store or on sale)
Chard: red, green and/or rainbow in any mix desired (or available at store or on sale)
Brussels sprouts: however many you want 
Cabbage: red and/or green
Any other veggies or fruits you have or want

Wash and Chop greens, including stems/stalks very fine (could also use other greens)
Peel and chop b sprouts fine
Peel any yucky layers off cabbage, chop as desired
Prepare and chop other veggies/ fruits (e.g, oranges like yours, blue berries, apple, etc) as desired 

Dressing: pour small amount (or as desired) of olive oil (I like strongly flavored one) over salad, then squeeze 1/2 or whole lime over salad (dependent in size of salad, lime-ee-ness desired) and sprinkle with cayenne pepper or chili to taste (start lightly). Mix salad, taste to see if need more dressing or to increase any dressing ingredients.

That's it. :-)

Love, mom
