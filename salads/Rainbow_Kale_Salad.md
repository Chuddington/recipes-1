From http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/recipe/rainbow-kale-slaw.

Serves 4.

Lacinato kale, also known as dinosaur kale, isn't as tough as curly kale and
lends itself well to raw salads like this one. This recipe will easily double
for a big group or potluck.

Ingredients: 

- 1 bunch lacinato (a.k.a. dinosaur) kale, thick stems removed and leaves thinly sliced
- 4 cups shredded red cabbage (about 1 small head), quartered and cored)
- 2 navel oranges or Clementines, peeled and segmented
- 1 small red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 large red bell pepper, cored, seeded and thinly sliced
- 1/3 cup sunflower seeds
- 1/4 cup cup Dijon mustard
- 1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (from about 1 small orange)
- 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
 
Directions:

1. In a large bowl, combine kale, cabbage, orange segments, onion, bell pepper
   and sunflower seeds. 
2. In a small bowl, whisk together mustard, orange juice, vinegar and pepper. 
3. Pour over the kale mixture and toss to coat. Serve immediately or
   refrigerate for up to 2 days.
