Makes approximately 10 tablespoon-sized bites.  These are like homemade lara bars.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup (6-7) fresh medjool dates (pitted)
- 1/2 cup raw pecans
- 2 Tablespoons raw, organic cacao
- 2 Tablespoons unsweetened shredded coconut

## Directions

Place pecans and coconut into a high-speed blender or food processor. Process on high until ingredients are a flour-like consistency.

Add the remaining ingredients to the blender/processor, and blend on medium to high until fully incorporated into the dry ingredients.

Dump the mixture into a bowl. Take a tablespoon worth of the mixture in between your hands, rolling to form a ball. Repeat until all of the mixture is used.

Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to five days. (If they can last that long!)
