Serves: 20

Ingredients:

- 2 large egg whites
- 1/4 cup raw honey
- 1 teaspoon vanilla or orange extract
- 3 cups finely shredded unsweetened coconut

Directions:

Preheat your oven to 400º F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, whisk together the egg whites, honey, and extract until blended. Stir in the shredded coconut until completely coated with the egg white mixture.
Scoop the coconut mixture onto the lined baking sheet with a small cookie scoop, creating 1.5″ balls.
Bake for 10-15 minutes until the coconut starts to turn a golden brown on the edges. Remove from the oven and cool completely.
Notes
Variations: Add a few teaspoons of orange zest or lemon zest; dip macaroons in chocolate or drizzle over the top; make nest-shaped macaroons and secure pastel Easter egg candies with a bit of melted chocolate for a fun Easter treat. Sweeteners: Substitute honey with ½ cup granulated sugar, coconut sugar, or other sweetener of your choosing. Coconut: Use finely shredded coconut for the best results. Coconut flakes won’t stick together in ball form as easily as its finely shredded counterparts.
