# Recipe: Molten Chocolate Cakes

By Jean-Georges Vongerichten

Active: 20 Min
Total Time: 35 Min
Servings: Makes Four 6-Ounce Cakes

It seems as though every restaurant in America offers a version of this amazing
cake created by master chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. But his supremely rich
and chocolaty original is in a class by itself.

Ingredients:

- 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter
- 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, preferably Valrhona
- 2 eggs
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/4 cup sugar
- Pinch of salt
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1. Preheat the oven to 450Â°. Butter and lightly flour four 6-ounce ramekins.
   Tap out the excess flour. Set the ramekins on a baking sheet.
2. In a double boiler, over simmering water, melt the butter with the
   chocolate. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with the egg yolks, sugar and
   salt at high speed until thickened and pale.
3. Whisk the chocolate until smooth. Quickly fold it into the egg mixture along
   with the flour. Spoon the batter into the prepared ramekins and bake for 12
   minutes, or until the sides of the cakes are firm but the centers are soft.
   Let the cakes cool in the ramekins for 1 minute, then cover each with an
   inverted dessert plate. Carefully turn each one over, let stand for 10
   seconds and then unmold. Serve immediately.

Make Ahead: The batter can be refrigerated for several hours; bring to room
temperature before baking.
Suggested Pairing: Chocolate is too intense and bitter for many sweet wines,
but not port. Try this dessert with a Ruby Porto.
