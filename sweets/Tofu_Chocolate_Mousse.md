Recipe: Tofu Chocolate Mousse

This is a (vegan) chocolate mousse from Tosca Reno's Eat Clean recipe book.

Servings: 4

Ingredients:

- 3/4 cup dark chocolate chips or bars broken into pieces
- 12 oz silken tofu at room temperature, drained
- 1/2 cup warmed skim, soy, rice, or almond milk

Directions:

1. Melt chocolate chips in a double boiler or in the microwave.  Make sure to let the chocolate melt slowly.  Stir until chocolate is uniformly smooth.
2. In a food processor, combine tofu, melted chocolate, warmed milk and vanilla.  Process until smooth.
