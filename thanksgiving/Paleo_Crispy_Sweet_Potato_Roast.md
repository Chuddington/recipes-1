Crispy Sweet Potato Roast

http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2014/11/crispy-sweet-potato-roast/

This is a beautiful looking recipe.  It helps to cook it in the dish you will serve it in.  It could use more flavor.  Mine did not crisp up, despite cooking it uncovered for 40 minutes instead of 20.  More heat?

Ingredients:

- 3 tablespoons salted or unsalted butter, melted
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- Coarse salt and black pepper or red pepper flakes to taste
- 5 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced thin
- 2 shallots, peeled and sliced thin

Heat oven to 375°F (190°C). Heat butter and oil together until butter has
melted. Pour 2 tablespoons of the mixture in the bottom of a 2-quart baking
dish. (Mine is 9.5-by-12-inches, if that helps.) Sprinkle butter/oil puddle
with some salt and pepper. Arrange your potato slices vertically in the dish.
Add a sliver of shallot between every few slices of potato, if desired. Brush
tops of potatoes with remaining butter/oil and season generously with more salt
and pepper. Cover dish with foil and bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until potatoes
are tender and almost fully cooked. Increase oven heat to 450F (230°C), remove
foil and let roast another 10 to 20 minutes, until tops of potatoes are nicely
browned.
